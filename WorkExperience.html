                                When I found out that I had a 4-month break between 1st and 2nd year of University, I decided
                                that I wanted to do something valuable with my time and look for a short-term internship. I found
                                that all the Software Development internships being advertised were for 2nd years+ only. So, I decided
                                to source my own opportunity by getting in touch with local companies and ended up being offered a position
                                at TSS Infrastructure Services.

                                My role here was to use an existing Work Management Platform that was built 
                                in WPF as a base to recreate the
                                system as a web version using C# MVC ASP.NET with HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, T-SQL, JavaScript
                                and jQuery. Having no experience with MVC, Bootstrap, JavaScript and jQuery, this role was a great
                                learning curve for me and a
                                fantastic opportunity to learn some new skills.

                                I learnt a lot from the team in the time I
                                was there and managed to
                                begin working virtually autonomously after only 3 weeks which was considered a huge success
                                considering my
                                inexperience. In my time at TSS I exceeded all expectations and built 3 main modules of the Work
                                Management Platform which handled the payment process for subcontractors amongst other things.

                                I was brought into RZ to work within their IT recruitment function. They had previously done some recruitment for their
                                clients in the IT market and brought me on board to expand their presence in the national market. My role was to
                                come up with and execute an effective business development strategy using contacts I already had in the industry as
                                well as networking with potential new clients. Once I started the process of working with a client, I would liaise
                                with them on any current open vacancies in order to understand their needs and then use my candidate attraction
                                skills to fill those vacancies.

                                    I joined Hays initially as a Resourcer before being promoted to Recruitment Consultant in February 2016. Having no
                                    prior recruitment experience, this role was a massive learning curve for me. I very quickly built up a knowledge
                                    and understanding of the IT recruitment industry. In this role I built the business up using my skills in business
                                    development to develop relationships with key clients. I had 11 contractors working for me at the time I finished
                                    with Hays.
