                        I'm currently studying in my second year at Sheffield Hallam University on the BEng Software
                        Engineering course.
                        Software Development is my passion and is the reason why after 3 years in the recruitment
                        industry, I decided to
                        leave my career behind and move 60 miles away to put myself in the best position to learn my
                        trade. I am a driven and reliable professional person with a passion to
                        achieve my set targets and personal goals.

                <div class="text">
                    <p>
                        I started my programming journey by learning basic C++ in the console and C# in Windows Forms.
                        This is where
                        I learned all the basics of programming (conditional statements, passing parameters between
                        functions etc.).
                        From here I quickly moved onto object-oriented programming using C# (in both Windows Forms and
                        ASP.NET).
                    </p>

                    <p><br />
                        When I started my second year, I began to broaden my horizons and learnt object-oriented
                        programming in C++
                        as well as learning Java from the ground up. I like going the extra mile when learning new
                        skills in order
                        to give myself the best chance in my career possible. I do this because it is something I
                        genuinely have a
                        passion for and enjoy.
                    </p>

                    <p><br>
                        When I got my first opportunity to work as a Software Developer during a summer internship with
                        TSS
                        Infrastructure Services, I had some knowledge of ASP.NET however I had never used MVC before.
                        This was a
                        great platform for me to further my skills with a new technology. Lastly, I began learning PHP
                        at the
                        beginning of my second year in University and it's used in this website amongst other projects.

                        Web Development is a big passion of mine (as you may be able to tell by this website) and is
                        also the aspect of
                        development that I am most comfortable with. My first foray into Web Development was at the
                        beginning of
                        my first year in University and it was creating a personal portfolio website like this one. I
                        learnt a
                        considerable amount about HTML and CSS in this time however it wasn't until my role with TSS
                        where I really
                        got my teeth into the finer details of Web Development. I learned JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap
                        and went much
                        deeper into HTML/CSS (alongside other back-end/database languages).
                    </p>

                    <p><br />
                        I decided that with all the skills and knowledge I had compared to when I first created my
                        personal
                        portfolio website, that I could recreate it to be way better, more user friendly and functional
                        than
                        the old one. That's when I decided to create this website.

                    <h3>Source Control</h3>

                    <p>
                        For University and personal projects, I use GitHub Desktop for all my source control. This is partly because it 
                        gives me a platform to share my work to a wider audience and also because I find it to be a really user friendly
                        bit of software. Whilst I was working with TSS Infrastructure I was exposed to Visual Studio's inbuilt Team
                        Foundation Server as a way of source control and as a result, this is also something I'm very comfortable with.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Databases</h3>

                    <p>
                        I have used SQL and databases in a number of projects, both in University and in the workplace. In University I
                        have used both Oracle SQL Developer and MySQL (alongside PHP) whereas I have used SQL Server Management Studio
                        in a commercial environment. SQL is something I feel very comfortable with irrespective of environment.
