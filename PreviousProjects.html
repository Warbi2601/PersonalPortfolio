                        <p>
                            This was a project undertaken across 3 months as part of my Component Programming Module in
                            my first year of
                            University. It was developed in C# Windows Forms. The final version of the
                            game includes numerous features including randomised colouring of each block, endless
                            generating levels that shows a running points tally as you
                            progress through using both a tally in game as well as on each "Next Level" and "End Game"
                            Screen.

                        <p>
                            This was developed in C# (ASP.NET Framework) and works alongside an SQL database. It has
                            the functionality to
                            create users, create new boards, post on those boards, view all the posts that user has
                            made and change password.
                            The administrator account can also view all the users account details and delete users
                            should they wish. This was my
                            introductory project into ASP.NET and taught me a lot about server-side programming.

                            This was developed as part of a group project in C# (Windows Forms) and was created with
                            the idea that if you took
                            the UI away, the program would work if integrated into the infrastructure of a car park.
                            This includes all the
                            validation around tickets and payment and works with sensors to detect entries and exits.

                            This was a Christmas project that was part of my Fundamentals of Programming Module in my
                            first year at
                            University. It's a simple program that's key function is to take a number and
                            print a Christmas Tree of that height. The program includes a few
                            extra features outside what was asked of me including relevant colours for the tree, trunk
                            and decoration as well as a
                            random decoration atop the tree each time.

                            This website itself is a good example of my web development skills. It was built from scratch using HTML/CSS
                            for the structure and styling, jQuery for a few nice visual features as well as the "Page Last Updated"
                            information in the footer. I used PHP as the server-side language in order to handle the "Contact Me" form.
                            I did all this in my spare time alongside University because it's something I genuinely enjoy.
